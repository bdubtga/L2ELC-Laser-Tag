- Started making breadboard version of the remnote circuit
- Had to swap A4 & A5 on pcb to match SCA & SCL for the lcd
- running i2c scanner to find adress of lcd
- when lcd is plugged in and joystickk all the way down it still shows 10 on joystick when when lcd unplugged it shows 0 (bug, somethigns bleeding over)
