# Laser Tag Robot - NCEA Level 3 Electronics Project

## Introduction
The Laser Tag Robot is a project that combines electronics, programming, and robotics to create an interactive laser tag game. The objective is to design and build a robot and controlling to play a simple game of laser tag.

## Features
- Drive System: The robot uses to rear motors to drive with an omnidirectional wheel at the front.
- Target Detection: Sensors are used to detect targets.
- Laser Emitter: The robot emits lasers to tag targets.
- Wireless Communication: The robot communicates wirelessly with a central control unit.

## Working On
- PCB Design: Currently dwesigning both the remote and robot pcb using EasyEDA.
- Robot Design: Currently designing the robot using Fusion 360.

## Future Improvements
- Add two way rf communication so the robot can send data back to the controller.
