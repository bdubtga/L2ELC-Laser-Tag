### Initial Breadboard Testing
- Started making a breadboard version of the remote circuit.
- Swapped A4 and A5 on the PCB to match SCA and SCL for the LCD.
- Ran an I2C scanner to find the address of the LCD.
- Noticed a bug where the LCD still shows 10 on the joystick when it's plugged in and the joystick is all the way down, but shows 0 when the LCD is unplugged (something is bleeding over).

### Saturday 13/5/2023
- Added a power button to the Controller & Robot circuit diagram.
- Designed the shape of the controller on the PCB to maximize space.
- Added holes to the controller PCB to securely attach it.

### Wednesday 17/5/2023
- Started designing the robot.
- Designed and tested a mount for the yellow geared motors using a 3D printer.

### Friday 26/5/2023
- Continued working on the robot 3D model.

### Wednesday 31/5/2023
- Built a prototype robot to test all the motors and make sure everything functions as expected.

### Friday 2/6/2023
- Continued working on the robot test vehicle.
- Found a suitable mount for the servo motor.
- Mounted the laser to the servo and made it spin.

### Saturday 3/6/2023
- Tested the accuracy of the servo at different distances using the laser.
- Finished building the robot prototype.
- Started coding the robot and controller.
- Used serial communication to control the robot until the controller was finished.
- Powered the servos off the battery instead of the Arduino using a level shifter.
- Adjusted the trim on the motors to ensure straight driving.
- Built a temporary controller with two buttons and a potentiometer to test driving while waiting for the PCB.
- Added an antenna to the bot and controller for better signal strength.
- Checked the range and delay before and after adding the antenna.
- Noticed that input starts to get delayed at longer distances and the driving performance is not as good, but there was a significant improvement with the antenna.

### Tuesday 6/6/2023
- Planned the next couple of weeks of work.

### Wednesday 7/6/2023
- Helped Ryan add headlights and brake lights to his vehicle.
- Fixed the 3D printer again because Alex broke it.
- Started printing Mr. Gilvear's chess project.

### Thursday 13/6/2023
- Started designing vehicle in Fusion 360.
- Designed wheels.
- Modelled arduino.
- Modelled wheel but then decided to make custom wheels.
### Friday 16/6/2023
- Tested CNY70 with fresnel lens to mkae target bigger.
- Got controller pcb
### Tuesday 20/6/2023
- Soldered arduino pins onto pcb
- Soldered joystick onto pcb
- Soldered LCD onto pcb
- Soldered buttons onto pcb
- Soldered battery connector onto pcb
- Soldered power switch onto pcb
- reprinted top peice with new holes & improved lcd mount mechanisim (new holes for power switch and power indicator led)
### Friday 30/6/2023
- Started swapping to new controller top peice
- Started carbon fibre lcd mount with updated attachment
- New top peice was printed bad and all tolerences are awful (wont fit) so I started reprinting it
- thought about using mecanum wheels but decied it would be easier to use two wheels and a caster
- ran every motor at full to see if there was enouh power
- servos did not have enough power so I will add another voltager regulator
- new new top peice is done and fits will assemble soon
- printed Carbon fibre lcd mount with updated attachment
- print done and fits in ebtter controller top perfect
- HOLY SHIT THE POWER BUTTON HAS AN LED IN IT so im using the led I added as an extr aindicator not sure where im conecting it to yet EDIT; cancel that ima use that hole for laser for easy calibration of cny70

### Wednesday 19/07/2023
- Made mind map for planning standard
- could use generative design in fusion 360 to create vehicle
