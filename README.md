# Laser Tag Robot - NCEA Level 2 Electronics Project

## Introduction
The Laser Tag Robot is an NCEA Level 2 Electronics project that combines electronics, programming, and robotics to create an interactive laser tag game. The objective is to design and build a robot and controller to play a simple game of laser tag.

## Features
- Drive System: The robot uses two rear motors to drive with an omnidirectional wheel at the front.
- Target Detection: Sensors are used to detect targets.
- Laser Emitter: The robot emits lasers to tag targets.
- Wireless Communication: The robot communicates wirelessly with a central control unit.

## Working On
- PCB Design: Currently designing both the remote and robot PCB using EasyEDA.
- Robot Design: Currently designing the robot using Fusion 360.

## Future Improvements
- Add two-way RF communication so the robot can send data back to the controller.
